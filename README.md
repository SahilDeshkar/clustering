AI-Enhanced Customer Segmentation Platform
Description
The AI-Enhanced Customer Segmentation Platform is a web-based application built using Streamlit. It leverages K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. The platform provides interactive visualizations, statistical summaries, and AI-powered insights to help businesses make data-driven decisions. Users can upload their datasets or use a sample dataset, select features for clustering, and visualize the results in 2D or 3D. Additionally, the platform integrates with Google's Gemini AI to generate actionable marketing insights for each customer segment.
